This was a really fun project to make and I am satisfied with the result. I learned so much in making it, it was so nice to find another projects in Discord and the one fron Chris McCoy really inspired me.
I am looking forward to keep learning APIs and more functionalities. Also open to keep learning and getting inspired from the community!
