This was a really fun project to make and I am satisfied with the result. I learned so much making it, it was so nice to find another projects in Discord and the one from Chris McCoy really inspired me.
I am looking forward to keep learning APIs and more functionalities. I am also open to keep learning and let myself getting inspired by the community!
